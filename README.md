# Python Email Scrapper

Python Email Scrapper is a concise and a basic python script which scans a given URL (target URL) and all the consecutive links inside it
to extract as many emails as possible. It is highly useful for ReConnaissance purposes if you are trying to get into ethical hacking!

## How to use?

Majority of the packages are already pre-built in python if you are using v3.10+. If you face any problem with any of the packages you can
always `pip install` them.

```console
#clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/officialHaze/email-scrapper.git
#change into the cloned directory
$ cd email-scrapper
#check the code if you are getting any warning for any of the packages and pip install them
#then run the script
$ python3 email_scrapper.py
```
